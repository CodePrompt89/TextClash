Hello!

thank you for downloading my rpg!!!
i hope you enjoy!!

from, CodePrompt89

(if you want to play the rpg look for either 
"TextClash ~ Alpha Development" or "TextClash ~ Development Release" <--- (reccomended)

TextClash Includes save files
so i made default level 1 characters for the rpg as an example......
but if you wish to create your own characters feel free to do so!!   :) 
(User1.bat is for the normal singleplayer and User1.plr is for the classic edition singleplayer/multiplayer)

TextClash Logins:

User1.bat

Username: User1
Password: 12345

User1.plr

Username: User1
Passwords are not used in the classic edition as it causes issues
with the way i currently have the multiplayer configured 
:/     (working on a fix soon!)


In the development copy of the game an admin menu is included in the settings 
(this is used for debugging and modding purposes) to enter the admin settings 
it requires both a login code and a verification pin both of which are provided below...... 
(note: these are only the default values)


the login code is: 741

the verification pin is: 9763

(P.S if you would like to change the 
login code or the verification pin you can change them in the admin settings or 
by editing the game's stored values)


Good luck on your adventure!!
